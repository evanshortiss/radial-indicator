# radial-indicator

This package is a fork of `radialIndicator` by Sudhanshu Yadav. 

I wanted to add TypeScript support and make it available via npm, but it
seemed unmaintained so forking was easier.

Notable changes:

* Version restarted at 1.0.0
* Added TypeScript support
* Removed AngularJS support
* Added standardjs linting/format
* Published on npm as `@evanshortiss/radial-indicator`
* Changed name from camel case to use hyphens

# Original README Content (Still Relevant)
